# Contributing to cwm

We release cwm as-is and hope it will be useful to the community.
However, we presently do not wish to make any guarantees on the level
of support or maintenance for the code released.

## Issues
Issues may be opened to flag functional or performance bugs,
preferably in the core inference logic. Tools released with
the library are here for demonstration purposes only and, as
such, will not be actively maintained or improved.

We will provide our best effort to fix correctness bugs, but
we will prioritize fixes at our discretion.

## Pull Requests
While you are welcome to open pull requests, we will integrate
them at our discretion, and may not merge directly.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
3. Test your changes and report the results in your PR.
4. Check that previous use cases still work and report in your PR.
5. Make sure your code passes the pre-commit checks.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You
only need to do this once to work on any of Meta's open source projects.

be licensed under the LICENSE file in the root directory of this
